abstract="Chameleon signatures were introduced by Krawczyk and Rabin, being non-interactive signature schemes that provide non-transferability. However, that first construction employs a chameleon hash that suffers from a key exposure problem: The non-transferability property requires willingness of the recipient in consequentially exposing a secret key, and therefore invalidating all signatures issued to the same recipient's public key. To address this key-revocation issue, and its attending problems of key redistribution, storage of state information, and greater need for interaction, an identity-based scheme was proposed in [1], while a fully key-exposure free construction, based on the elliptic curves with pairings, appeared later in [7].",

We propose a new trapdoor mechanism and derive from this technique three encryption schemes: a trapdoor permutation and two homomorphic probabilistic encryption schemes computationally comparable to RSA. Our cryptosystems, based on usual modular arithmetics, are provably secure under appropriate assumptions in the standard model.",

abstract="We present a general way to get a provably collision-resistant hash function from any (suitable) $\Sigma$−{\thinspace}protocol. This enables us to both get new designs and to unify and improve previous work. In the first category, we obtain, via a modified version of the Fiat-Shamir protocol, the fastest known hash function that is provably collision-resistant based on the standard factoring assumption. In the second category, we provide a modified version VSH* of VSH which is faster when hashing short messages. (Most Internet packets are short.) We also show that $\Sigma$−{\thinspace}hash functions are chameleon, thereby obtaining several new and efficient chameleon hash functions with applications to on-line/off-line signing, chameleon signatures and designated-verifier signatures.",

abstract="The new signature scheme presented by the authors in [9] is the first signature scheme based on the discrete logarithm problem that gives message recovery. The purpose of this paper is to show that the message recovery feature is independent of the choice of the signature equation and that all ElGamal type schemes have variants giving message recovery and achieve five new signature schemes giving message recovery. These schemes have different properties as to implementation and security. It turns out that the scheme proposed in [9] is the only inversionless scheme whereas the message recovery variant of the DSA requires computing of inverses in both generation and verification of signatures. In [9] two applications of message recovery were proposed. In the present paper it is shown how to combine ElGamal encryption and the message recovery scheme of [9] and how to securely integrate the DSA into Diffie-Hellman key exchange.",
